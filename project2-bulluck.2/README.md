Welcome to Game of Set!

INSTRUCTIONS
This game designed for two players. At the beginning of the game, there is a deck of 81 cards, all with different shapes (diamonds, squiggles, ovals), number of shapes (one, two, three), colors (red, green, purple), and shadings (solid, striped, open). 12 cards are laid out at the beginning of the game, and the players have to find a "Set" within the hand that is laid out. A set is three cards in which all of the features within the three cards are ALL THE SAME or ALL DIFFERENT. 
For example, 

card1 = ['diamond', 'one', 'open', 'red']
card2 = ['oval', 'two', 'open', 'green']
card3 = ['squiggle', 'three', 'open', 'purple']

would be a set since the shapes are ALL DIFFERENT, the number of shapes are ALL DIFFERENT, the shadings are ALL THE SAME, and the colors are ALL DIFFERENT for each card. 

The given set 

card1 = ['diamond', 'one', 'open', 'red']
card2 = ['diamond', 'two', 'open', 'green']
card3 = ['squiggle', 'three', 'open', 'purple']

would not be a set since the shapes of the card are not ALL THE SAME or ALL DIFFERENT. 

The game ends when there are no longer any cards in the deck to make a set, or the players have an option of setting a 5 minute timer for the entire game to make it more interesting. Each set found earns the player who found it a point. The player with the most points wins. 
Have fun! 

Type "ruby main.rb" into the terminal to run the game.
