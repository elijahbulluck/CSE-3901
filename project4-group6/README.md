# Project 4: Group 6 // Faculty Page Redesign

Project Description:
>The focus of this project was to create a new and improved look for a professor at The Ohio State University. Currently, faculty of the university have a webpage that displays some interesting information about them, their credentials, and what it is they do, but not all of the pages are visually appealing. Our goal was to redesign an existing webpage using minimal web design techniques in order to give an updated look and feel while improving versatility.

Technologies Utilized:
>For this redesign, we used only HTML and CSS in conjunction with Middleman as our static site generator. We learned about ERB and how that works to build scalable and reusable websites which we incorporated into a lot of our project. 

Challenges Faced:
>Some of the challenges we faced were reading errors from Middleman and figuring out what they mean in the scope of the project. In particular we had the "data" folder inside of the source folder when it needed to be at the same level and it took us a while to figure that out and be able to actually print out data to the webpage.

Running the Program:
>Since we are not hosting this webpage anywhere and instead will be view locally, we can let Middleman do all the heavy lifting. To compile your source files, type `bundle exec middleman build` in the terminal. Then, start a Middleman server by typing `bundle exec middleman server` in the terminal. This will open a localhost server at `http://localhost:4567/` where your information will be displayed. Follow that link or type it into your browser to see the finalized product.
