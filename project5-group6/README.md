# Project 5 - Group 6: The Game of Set, Reloaded

Project Description:
>The focus of this project was to create an updated Game of Set with Javascript that included visuals. We decided to take an array of .png files and turn them into cards that allow the user to visually see what cards they are selecting to give a more immersive user experience.

Technologies Utilized:
> The only technologies used were JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. JavaScript was used for the logic of the game: dealing cards, keeping score, checking sets, etc. The HTML was used for rendering the elements on the screen and creatin submission buttons to make the page interactive. Finally, CSS was used to style the page and make it cohesive and visually appealing.

Challenges Faced:
>Not only did we have generic problems like trying to learn a new language for the project or how to link the files together, but we also wanted to make sure we got practice with using branches for this project that also had some problems. In the beginning, we decided to make our own branches and all try our hand at writing some code to get our feet wet with JS. After that, we came together and decided who had the best blueprint and kind of built off that. For this project, the branch 'Eli' was decided to be used for most of the writing and commits and then merged into main at the end.

Running the Program:
>To run the program, all you need to do is open the idex.html file in your favorite browser and follow the prompts on the screen.

>Thank you for taking the time to read this and play our game of set!
